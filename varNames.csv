New degree-granting institutions that report offering a bachelor's degree on the current institutional characteristics file for the upcoming academic year, and have not yet reported bachelor's degrees on the current completions that covers the previous academic year  June 1-July 30 were assigned as follows:

If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above. If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above.

For institutions that reported zeros for bachelor's degrees of above and for levels below the bachelor's, the maximum number of programs by level was used to determine the primary classification."
15215,CCBASIC,"Carnegie Classification 2010 Update:  Basic Classification

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note- Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 to support its research program, and later published in 1973 for use by other researchers. Although this classification has undergone many changes over the years, the current release involves some significant changes from previous editions.

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The instructional program classification is based on three pieces of information: the level of undergraduate degrees awarded (associate’s or bachelor’s), the proportion of bachelor’s degree majors in the arts and sciences and in professional fields, and the extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it awards undergraduate degrees.

The distinction between arts and sciences and professional undergraduate majors is one that has been made in the Classification since 1987 (but only for undergraduate colleges), and researchers and others in the higher education community have also made similar distinctions. We are extending and elaborating the previous analysis by (1) applying it to almost all baccalaureate-level institutions, (2) making finer distinctions along the arts & sciences – professions continuum, and (3) recognizing a “middle ground” where the two domains exist in relative balance with respect to graduating students’ major concentrations. 

A high concentration of majors in the arts and sciences is not the same as a liberal arts education, and we do not view any particular location on this continuum as the special province of liberal education. Examples of high-quality liberal education exist across the spectrum.

Some institutions enroll no graduate students. Others may have graduate programs that operate relatively independently of the undergraduate program (such as a law school). Still others offer graduate education in most or all fields where they have undergraduate programs. And of course, some institutions fall between these extremes. By examining the number of undergraduate fields in which we also see graduate degrees, we can locate institutions along this continuum of undergraduate-graduate “coexistence.” Departments that teach only undergraduates can differ in many ways from those that also train graduate students. Examples of such differences include faculty activities and instructional resources.

It is important to emphasize that we do not view these continua (arts & sciences – professions or graduate coexistence) as signifying gradations in value or quality.
The categories are as follows:

Assoc: Associate’s. According to the degree data, these institutions awarded associate’s degrees but no bachelor’s degrees.

Assoc-Dom: Associate’s Dominant. These institutions awarded both associate’s and bachelor’s degrees, but the majority of degrees awarded were at the associate’s level.

A&S-F/NGC: Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, at least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Graduate Instructional Program Description

As a companion to the Undergraduate Instructional Program classification, this classification examines the nature of graduate education, with a special focus on the mix of graduate programs. In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusion.

The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded (master’s/professional or doctoral), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that do not award the doctorate, and one for doctoral-level institutions (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, we then classify institutions with respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.

For two categories of doctorate-granting institutions, we distinguish institutions offering medical education (defined as human or veterinary medical education, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine). Institutions in other categories may also offer medical education, but the numbers were not large enough to justify subcategories and we judged it preferable to differentiate with respect to the other graduate fields, rather than with respect to the presence or absence of medical education.

NOTE: Because a single doctoral-level degree (as defined in the IPEDS data collection of the National Center for Education Statistics) qualifies an institution for inclusion in the doctoral categories, a small number of institutions with large master’s or professional programs and modest doctoral-level programs are currently classified according to their doctoral programs.

The categories are listed below. The term “comprehensive” is used here to denote comprehensiveness of offerings across a range of fields. This is a different usage from that in previous editions of the Carnegie Classification.

S-Postbac/Ed: Single Postbaccalaureate (education). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in education but not in other fields.
S-Postbac/Bus: Single Postbaccalaureate (business). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in business but not in other fields.
S-Postbac/Other: Single Postbaccalaureate (other field). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in a single field other than education or business.
Postbac-Comp: Postbaccalaureate comprehensive. According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields, and degrees in one or more professional fields.
Postbac-A&S: Postbaccalaureate, arts & sciences dominant. These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields. They may also award master’s or professional degrees in other fields, but in lesser numbers.
Postbac-A&S/Ed: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (education dominant). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in education.
Postbac-A&S/Bus: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (business dominant). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in business.
Postbac-A&S/Other: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (other dominant fields). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in a professional field other than business or education.
Postbac-Prof/Ed: Postbaccalaureate professional (education dominant). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in education.
Postbac-Prof/Bus: Postbaccalaureate professional (business dominant). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in business.
Postbac-Prof/Other: Postbaccalaureate professional (other dominant fields). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in a field other than business or education.
S-Doc/Ed: Single doctoral (education). Based on the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in education but do not offer other graduate/professional education.
S-Doc/Other: Single doctoral (other field). Based on the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a single field other than education.
CompDoc/MedVet: Comprehensive doctoral with medical/veterinary. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields, and they also award degrees in medicine, dentistry, and/or veterinary medicine. They also offer professional education in other health professions or in fields such as business, education, engineering, law, public policy, or social work.
CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary). According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields. They also offer professional education in fields such as business, education, engineering, law, public policy, social work, or health professions other than medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine.
Doc/HSS: Doctoral, humanities/social sciences dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the humanities or social sciences. They may also offer professional education at the doctoral level or in fields such as law or medicine.
Doc/STEM: Doctoral, STEM dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the STEM* fields. They may also offer professional education at the doctoral level or in fields such as law or medicine.
Doc/Prof: Doctoral, professions dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the professions other than engineering (such as education, health professions, public policy, or social work). They may also offer professional education in law or medicine.

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

This new classification describes the undergraduate population with respect to three characteristics: the proportion who attend part- or full-time; achievement characteristics of first-year students; and the proportion of entering students who transfer in from another institution. Each of these captures important differences in the nature of the undergraduate population. They do not imply differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but they have implications for how an institution serves its students.

PT2: Higher part-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show at least 60 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

Mix2: Mixed part/full-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show 40–59 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

By grouping institutions according to the mix of students enrolled at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels, this classification provides a bird’s eye view of the student population. Exclusively undergraduate institutions are further broken down by level (two-year and four-year). For institutions with both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, institutions are grouped according to the distribution of full-time equivalent students across the two levels, giving an approximate measure of the student population’s “center of gravity.” As a result, it reflects important differences with respect to educational mission as well as institutional climate and culture—differences that can have implications for infrastructure, services, and resource allocation.

This classification describes institutions’ size and residential character. Because residential character applies to the undergraduate student body, exclusively graduate/professional institutions are not included. 

Size matters. It is related to institutional structure, complexity, culture, finances, and other factors. Indeed, it is probably the most influential omitted variable in the 1970 classification framework. Residential or nonresidential character reflects aspects of the campus environment, student population served, and the mix of programs and services that an institution provides.

Four-year institutions are divided into four categories of full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment and three categories of residential character. Neither characteristic implies differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but an institution’s location along the two continua generally corresponds to a distinctive mix of educational challenges and opportunities. Because few two-year institutions serve a residential population, these institutions are classified solely based on FTE enrollment.

The residential character measure is based on two attributes: the proportion of degree-seeking undergraduates who attend full-time and the proportion living in institutionally-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing. It is important to note the variety of situations of students who do not live in college or university housing. Some are true “commuting” students, while others may live with other students in rental housing on the periphery of campus, and still others are distance education students who rarely or never set foot on a campus.

The categories are as follows:

VS2: Very small two-year. Fall enrollment data show FTE* enrollment of fewer than 500 students at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

S2: Small two-year. Fall enrollment data show FTE enrollment of 500–1,999 students at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

15225,LANDGRNT,"Land Grant Institution

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""

16086,CBSA,"Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) - 5-digit code that identifies the Core Based Statistical Area,that an institution's address is associated with.  If an institution is not associated with a CBSA the value of this variable is not applicable (-2).

A CBSA is a geographic entity consisting of the county or counties associated with at least one core (urbanized area or urban cluster) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core.  Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are the two categories of Core Based Statistical Areas.

Metropolitan Statistical Area - A Core Based Statistical Area associated with at least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000. 

Micropolitan Statistical Area - A Core Based Statistical Area associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000.

To identify whether a CBSA is a Metropolitan Statistical Area or Micropolitan Statistical Area see variable CBSATYPE - CBSA Type Metropolitan or Micropolitan.
